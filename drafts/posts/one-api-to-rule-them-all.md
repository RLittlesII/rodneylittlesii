## Oh Rodney I have tasks.  I have events.  I don't need observables.

# One Api to Rule them all
- Can you mix Task execution with Events?
- Can you do it cleanly?
- Respond to an event trigger and wait for a Task to return?

Observables is a single API surface that allows you to cleanly iterate over both, combine them and act on them.
