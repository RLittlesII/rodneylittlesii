TODO!

- Why I got involved in OSS
- Why OSS is good
- What I have learned from OSS
- What I wish more OSS maintainers would do to help invite devs who might want to help.

# A better place to pilfer code than Stack Overflow!
- I look at OSS implementations to get ideas about different ways to structure code
- Because the code isn't imposed by business delivery dates, developers tend to use good software design patterns
    - Factory Pattern
    - Strategy Pattern
    - Builder Pattern
    - Mediator
