## Disclaimer
My only experience with Open Source Software (OSS) is in the dotnet community.  I understand that different communities have differeent concerns.

## Developer Ownership is powerful
- When devs own it they care about keeping it.
    - Tragedy of the commons


## Abuse of power is not tolerated

## Quality is an important metric
- OSS is dependend on by many developers to build their applications on top of
- Without a quality bar nobody would consume

## Failing fast is less risky than failing slow
- Point releases allow confident developers to find issues in your software
- Main line development
    - ci
    - automated unit tests
- Developers finding bugs is better than QA finding them
    - Developers give better detail about the crux of the issue
    - Developers 

## Branching, Releasing, Versioning
- Understanding the world of breaking changes
- Know what it is to have breaking API changes
- Understanding the concepts behind semver
- Software readiness

# Documentation
- Docs
- Issues
- Pull Requests
- RFC's

## Maintainability as a service
- Pull Requests add value
    - Ensures design decisions are respected
    - Ensures quality is met
        - Code coverage
        - Automated testing
- Processes
    - Issues to identify bugs
        - Templates
        - If templates aren't filled out correctly issues are closed
    - Issues with reproduction of the problem
        - proper reproduction of an issue is important
- Support

## The spirit of software
- To Solve a problem for a consumer
- To create something fun

## Don't reinvent the wheel

## Invest in the software
