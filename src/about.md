Title: About Me
---

My days are spent developing software with a focus on Xamarin, Web Api, Azure and Dev Ops.  My nights are filled with practice of Ying Jow Pai, the study of Northern Eagle Claw Kung Fu!  Somewhere between working to deliver quality software and aspiring to master my Kung Fu system, I find time to explore the .NET eco system.
